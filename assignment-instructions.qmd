## Assignment Overview

You will use R and Quarto to retrieve, analyze, and visualize species occurrence data from GBIF for a taxonomic group.

## Assigned Species Groups

| Student | Taxonomic Group | Example Species |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Student 1 | Large Carnivores | *Puma concolor* |
| Student 2 | Migratory Birds | *Turdus migratorius* |
| Student 3 | Marine Mammals | *Balaenoptera musculus* |
| Student 4 | Pollinators | *Bombus impatiens* |
| Student 5 | Reptiles | *Crotalus atrox* |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Repository Setup (5 points)

- [ ] Accept GitHub Classroom assignment
- [ ] Clone repository to your local machine
- [ ] Open `gbif-species-mapper.qmd` in RStudio

### Step 2: Species Customization (15 points)

- [ ] Modify the `species_name` parameter for your assigned species
- [ ] Adjust `country_code` if focusing on a specific region
- [ ] Set appropriate `max_records` (suggest 200-1000)
- [ ] Update map center coordinates for your study area

### Step 3: Data Analysis (40 points)

- [ ] Run all code chunks successfully
- [ ] Generate the interactive map with proper styling
- [ ] Create the temporal analysis plot
- [ ] Export CSV and HTML files to outputs folder

### Step 4: Research Questions (40 points)

Answer all 5 research questions with thoughtful, detailed responses that demonstrate understanding of the data patterns.

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points | Excellent (A) | Good (B) | Satisfactory (C) | Needs Improvement (D/F) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Code Execution** | 25 | All code runs without errors, produces expected outputs | Minor errors that don't affect final results | Some errors but main analysis works | Major errors prevent analysis |
| **Species Customization** | 20 | Appropriate species choice, well-justified parameters | Good species choice, reasonable parameters | Basic customization completed | Minimal or inappropriate customization |
| **Map Quality** | 20 | Professional, informative map with all features working | Good map with minor issues | Basic map functionality | Map missing key features or broken |
| **Analysis & Interpretation** | 20 | Insightful analysis, clear patterns identified | Good analysis with some insights | Basic analysis completed | Superficial or incorrect analysis |
| **Research Questions** | 15 | Thoughtful, detailed answers demonstrating understanding | Good answers showing comprehension | Basic answers meeting requirements | Incomplete or incorrect answers |

## Tips for Success

::: {.callout-tip}
## Getting Started
1. **Start early** - GBIF API calls can be slow
2. **Test with small datasets first** - Use `max_records = 50` initially
3. **Check species name spelling** - Verify on GBIF website first
4. **Document your process** - Add comments explaining your choices
5. **Ask for help** - Use GitHub issues or office hours
:::

## Common Issues and Solutions

::: {.callout-warning}
## Troubleshooting

**Species not found error:**
- Check scientific name spelling on [GBIF portal](https://www.gbif.org/)
- Try searching for genus only first
- Use `name_backbone()` function to test species names

**Too few records:**
- Expand geographic scope (remove country filter)
- Try genus-level search instead of species
- Check if species name has synonyms

**Map not displaying:**
- Check for missing coordinates
- Verify latitude/longitude are numeric
- Ensure leaflet package is loaded

**Large file sizes:**
- Reduce `max_records` parameter
- Filter by date range or geographic area
- Remove unnecessary columns before export
:::

## Submission Requirements

Your final submission must include:

1. **Completed Quarto notebook** (`gbif-species-mapper.qmd`) with:
   - Customized parameters for your species
   - All code chunks executed successfully
   - Research questions answered in full sentences
   - Professional formatting and clear explanations

2. **Generated files** in the `outputs/` folder:
   - HTML report (`gbif-species-mapper.html`)
   - CSV data file (`[species_name]_gbif_data.csv`)
   - Interactive map (`[species_name]_map.html`)

3. **Git commits** showing your work progress:
   - Initial parameter customization
   - Data retrieval and analysis
   - Final answers and cleanup

## Academic Integrity

::: {.callout-important}
## Academic Honesty Policy
- You may discuss general approaches with classmates
- All code and analysis must be your own work
- Properly cite any external resources used
- Do not share your specific species data or code solutions
:::

## Late Submission Policy

- 10% deduction per day late
- No submissions accepted after 1 week past due date
- Contact instructor immediately if you anticipate problems

**Good luck with your analysis!** Remember, the goal is to learn about biodiversity data and spatial analysis, not just complete the assignment.
